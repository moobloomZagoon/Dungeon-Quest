This project holds the code and assets i creates for a NES game i made.

The game is called Dungeon Quest and is created out of fun and an interest i have in Retro Gaming. The fact that i had to create a PWS (Profiel Werkstuk) for the Informatica subject in school did also help.

The project was created with a tool names: Nesmaker.
[project page](https://github.com/chronosv2/NESMaker_Public_Code_Repository).
[web page](https://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/).

The music was created with a tool named Famitracker.
[project page](https://github.com/Dn-Programming-Core-Management/Dn-FamiTracker).
[web page](https://famitracker.org/).

As i have used example code and assets as basis for some parts i am giving it back to the community. You cab create your own fork of the project and start using it as a basis for a game of your own.
